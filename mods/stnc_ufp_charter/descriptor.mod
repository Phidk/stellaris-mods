description="Always get the classic Federation (with canonical Vulcan). This lightweight submod guarantees an AI-led 2161.01.01 formation (UE, Andoria, Tellar, Vulcan) and also enforces the Vulcan reformation to the Confederacy of Surak around 2158+, so the lineup matches canon. It quietly suppresses UE early derailers, cleans up founder conflicts in 2160 (ends internal wars, exits conflicting federations), delays the charter if external wars are active, then hands off to STNC's native charter for authentic effects. Lore-friendly, hands-off, excludes Mirror/BotF, and respects player-controlled founders. Early-stage: currently only directly tested on the Large Alpha/Beta map in observer mode."
